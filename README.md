## bug-bounty

Conducted Bug Bounty(sort of) in my college for an IT event.
It is a python script consisting of programs with bugs.
Participants were given 60 mins to find all the bugs, and each bug had a bounty on it.
Programs are generated randomly for every participant.
First round has C programs and the Second round has Java programs.
